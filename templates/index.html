                This project is a python script for building and training a
                convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying malaria cells
                as either infected or uninfected based on their microscopic
                images. The impact of this project is that it helps automate the
                process of malaria parasitized RBCs detection, which is a crucial task in
                diagnosing and treating the disease. By training a machine
                learning model on a large dataset of microscopic images, the
                model can learn to accurately identify infected cells, reducing
                the workload and increasing the speed of diagnosis for medical
                professionals. The use of this project is in medical research and
                diagnosis, where it can be used to quickly and accurately
                classify malaria parasitized RBCs, reducing the time and resources needed
                for manual inspection. Additionally, this code serves as a good
                starting point for researchers and practitioners looking to
                build similar models for cell classification and other medical
                imaging tasks.

            <h2 class="display-6">Approach</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                The ML part in this project is written in python programming
                language. It is a script for detecting malaria parasitized RBCs in a given
                set of images. The script uses computer vision techniques and a
                convolutional neural network (CNN) to train and classify images
                as either infected with malaria or not infected. The code then
                loads the training and testing data. The data consists of
                thousands of images of malarial cells, some infected and some
                not infected. It resizes the images to a fixed size of 64x64
                pixels, appends the resized images to a list 'dataset' and their
                respective labels (0 for infected and 1 for not infected) to
                another list 'label'. The data is then split into training and
                testing datasets using the 'train_test_split' function from
                'sklearn' library. Finally, it defines the architecture of
                the CNN using 'keras' functions for the model input,
                convolutional layers, pooling, normalization, dropout, dense
                layers, and the output. The architecture is then compiled using
                'keras' and the model is trained on the training data using the
                'fit' function. The trained model is then evaluated on the
                testing data. The accuracy of this model is approximately 95%+.

            <h2 class="display-6">Deployment</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                We used the Flask web framework with python and Keras deep
                learning library to build a RESTful API. The code creates a
                Flask web application, loads a pre-trained image classification
                model, and creates a route that predicts the class of an
                uploaded image file (infected or uninfected). The image is
                processed and passed as input to the deep learning model, which
                returns the predicted class index. The class index is then
                converted to a string class label using a dictionary, and
                returned as a response to the client who made the prediction
                request. It is hosted using Replit.
