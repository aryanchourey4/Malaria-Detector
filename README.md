## Problem Statement - Malaria Control using AI - *(BioTech)* ##
Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease, claiming over 400,000 lives each year, mainly children under 5. By targeting the water bodies where mosquitoes lay eggs, the disease can be controlled or even eliminated completely. Explore more datasets to understand the problem well and come up with a solution to curb this in a sustainable manner.

### Datasets for reference: ###

Dataset  | Link
---------- | ----------
The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a dataset on malaria cases and deaths worldwide. This data can be used to understand the scale and scope of the problem, as well as identify high-risk areas.  | https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/malaria
The Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) provides a dataset on malaria vector distribution and behavior. This data can be used to understand the biology and behavior of mosquitoes that transmit malaria, which can inform control efforts.  | https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/global-malaria-incidence-prevalence-mortality-geospatial-estimates-2000-2019 
The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) provides a dataset on malaria risk, including information on the distribution of malaria vectors, parasite prevalence, and population density. This data can be used to understand the factors that contribute to malaria transmission and identify high-risk areas. | https://data.malariaatlas.org/
